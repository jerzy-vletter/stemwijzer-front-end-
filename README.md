herstart met project op 10/9/2020


29-9-2020 - merge had to happen to fix a bug where i could use my coding software to push a commit to github.F

25/05/2021 - project has been worked on for about 2 weeks now after a dib in activate, have added a dev branch where i store code that isn't fully working yet so the master brachs stays as a version manager of the sorts, so if i code something that breaks the code in a way that i can't fix i have a backup of stable code
